# Web-Scrapping

• Name of the program: Program to obtain live COVID-19 
information from web using BeautifulSoup.
• Operation: By using Web scraping(HTML), CSV file and Word 
document I have written a program that scraps data from web 
based on our inputs. The program asks for input and if we give 1, 
it collects district wise COVID-19 information of Karnataka state 
and the data is transferred to csv file and word document can be 
generated from csv file. If we give input as 2, it collects the state 
wise COVID-19 information of India and we can view total cases, 
total death , active cases of India by providing input as 3.
The above whole thing will work only when there is a wi-fi 
connection. Otherwise it will inform you to check internet 
connection.
